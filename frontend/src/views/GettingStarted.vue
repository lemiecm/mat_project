                    On our <strong> Sessions </strong> panel user is presented with all sessions created by anyone in our system.
                    <br> As you might observe we have two different <strong>paying plans</strong>.
                    <br> The general difference is the fact that <strong> Premium </strong> plan comes on-server model aggregation
                    <br> and allows users to create <strong>Private</strong> sessions.
                    <br> That is why, depeneding on the plan you chose different filter panel you will get.
                    <br> For the both of plans you have the following filters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Filter by session name
